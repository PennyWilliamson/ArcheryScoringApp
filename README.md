# ArcheryScoringApp
This is the aplliction written for my BIT 7090 final project for an external client.

If I was to redo my final project I would:
tidy up the code, some of it is a bit complicated and could be simplified.
I would also reuse code more than I have, and tidy up some of my math.
I would also make it multi user by not hard coding archer details and instead eihter getting them from prefernces, or database,
with some sort of sign up.
And I would probably move to another framework, like Ionic 3 or 4 for smaller UI.
